        I have begun working in the IT field since 2017. Back then, I was into
        networking since I had Network+ and MCSE certifications, I was implementing Microsoft based
        networks for several companies. When I gathered enough knowledge about Linux I
        started to take Linux based network projects as well and that was when I got LPIC1 and LPIC2 certifications.

      <p>
        After that, I began to work in a Fintech company as a Tech Help Desk
        and after a short time, I got promoted to become Tech Support Lead on that company.

        In the next chapter of my professional career, I realized that I'm into programming as well
        so I begin learning myself to program. I started by learning HTML, CSS and then
        I have learned Bootstrap, JavaScript and then its frameworks. After learning
        the basics of web development I have been transferred to the Devs Department.

        After my departure from the FinTech company, I started to work as a freelance
        developer and I took several projects, I have developed softwares using Angular and Vue.js
        which all of my projects can bee seen in my

        account and I am currently working on a product which is based on Angular 8.
        I haven't got any chance to work with React.js but I will embrace the experience!

        I have also begun to write and share my little knowledge in Medium and
        Virgool which you can follow me.
        I also contribute to StackOverflow.
