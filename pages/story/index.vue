        Hi, I'm Hossein and I am 22! I am studying Atomic Physics but I'm more
        into computers than Physics!

      <p>
        I have begun working in the IT field since 2017 when I was 20. back then
        I was into networking since I have MCSE, I was implementing Microsoft
        based networks and then when I moved into Linux I started to work on
        Linux based network as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I begin to work in a Fintech company as a Tech Support Help
        Desk and after a short time, I get promoted to become Tech Support Lead
        on that company.
      </p>
      <p>
        In early 2019 I started realizing that I'm into programming as well so I
        begin studying C# at first but I did not start learning seriously until
        May 2019 when I have been transferred to be a part of Front End Team at
        XEOPS (yeah right! I did start with C# but then I have decided to choose
        Front end over backend).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0 pb-5">
        In the last couple of months I have worked on three projects, one of
        them is Angular and the other two are Vue.js. I haven't got any chance
        to work with React.js but I will embrace the experience!
